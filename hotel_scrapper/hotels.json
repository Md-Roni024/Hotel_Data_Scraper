The lift doors were very sticking and didn\\u2019t seem to open properly and had a bad smell to them. \\n\\nChecked in ok, went to our room which had the heating on full blast and the temp was showing at 39c. We tried to open the window but it was held closed by just a screw. \\n\\nThe bed was very comfy to sleep on but we only stayed one night so wasn\\u2019t too bad. \\n\\nThe next morning we were disturbed by housekeeping entering our room at 8am saying hello then quickly exiting and then hoovering the corridors banging the walls and our door. We told reception about this but was greeted by a rude member of staff who pointed to another lady then walked off. The lady behind the desk said she\\u2019ll talk to housekeeping again so sounds like this happens a lot.\\n\\nWe then decided to go for breakfast to be told it was \\u00a315 each!

We spend very little time in the room but consider it a treat to catch up on the news from the bed.  I also would have liked better clothes storage facilities and less single use plastic- a mini fridge would have helped with this with the milk situation. Five coat hangers on a wall was not adequate with open storage general use shelves for four days of clothes for two people.  The lack of any towel rails  and only one hook in the whole bathroom was annoying and inconvenient. Our towels were changed needlessly because they were damp rather than dirty.  Unfortunately the shower had a bad drain smell too.  However, the room was clean and tidy. We did have a kettle with one breakfast tea bag, one peppermint tea bag and a coffee bag each. The bed was comfortable and the shower was spacious.  Our room was at the corner of the second floor and was quiet with a great view of the Victoria docks and convenient for the DLR, the Emirates cable car and the Elizabeth line.

There were so many customers made the complaints as the rooms weren\\u2019t same as pictures on the website. 1 lady was crying as the staff refused to cancel for her and said she doesn\\u2019t care. If she want to cancel, she will loose her money. Other man got pissed of with the same situation of the room was completely different with what they saw online.   They even forced me to check out at 9am instead of 11:00 as normal even though our room is prepaid but it took forever for check in as they said there was no booking for us. Many times I asked them please double check, but the manager asked us to leave otherwise they will call the police. That was so horrible when I got a young child, and that was late night.

Even not so easy to pass through the room because all the room space was the bed with few centimeters free space to pass.   We really didn\\u2019t want some big room, because we came to be outside most of the time but every morning was challenging to dress up. Coffee machine also was out of service.  There is paid service to store luggage for 12 hours after check out, and I have not any problem to pay for this service, but I expected there is toilet when we came to get our luggage before we leave to airport. And it\\u2019s not.\",\n                \"rating\": 3,\n                \"avatarImgUrl\": \"\",\n                \"reviewDate\": \"2022-09-30 12:27:22\"\n              },\n              \"selectedReviewList\": [\n                {\n                  \"nickName\": \"Guest User\",\n                  \"regionCode\": \"\",\n                  \"content\": \"My son and I stayed here last week for 3 nights.

Walked in to the reception desk to be welcomed by a staff member on the phone speaking with a guest that was complaining die to their room not being cleaned. Once the call was finished he checked me in very quickly and not welcoming at all. I was not given any information about breakfast times or any other amenities. Basically paid for the room and got given the room key and directed to the elevator as if I was inconveniencing him. Got into the room looked beautiful, however was surrounded by a construction site outside my window. When heeting ready for bed wanted to wash my face so took the smaller towel in the cupboard to see that it had been used and looked like there was mascara or a black stain from previous guests. Then I saw that they do room service so decided to give them a call as I was thirsty and no drinks were offered in the room. I called them 6 times without any answer and eventually gave up. Unfortunately will not be returning as the price I paid I expected at least better service from staff and cleanliness.\",\n                  \"rating\": 2,\n                  \"avatarImgUrl\": \"\"\n                }\n              ],\n              \"stimulation\": {\n                \"lastBookTime\": {\n                  \"value\": 0,\n                  \"unit\": \"Hour\"\n                }\n              },\n              \"commentTags\": [\n                \"Great rooms\",\n                \"Convenient location\"\n              ],\n              \"encourage\": {\n                \"breakfast\": true,\n                \"cancellation\": false\n              },\n              \"displayPrice\": {\n                \"price\": 60,\n                \"taxPrice\": 72,\n                \"oriPrice\": 0,\n                \"checkIn\": \"2024-08-18\"\n              },\n              \"trafficList\": [\n                {\n                  \"id\": 1,\n                  \"type\": 2,\n                  \"description\": \"16.2km from Manchester Airport\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"id\": 2,\n                  \"type\": 3,\n                  \"description\": \"750m from Manchester Piccadilly\"\n                }\n              ],\n              \"hotelFacilityList\": [\n                {\n                  \"id\": 2,\n                  \"name\": \"Restaurant\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"id\": 20,\n                  \"name\": \"24 hour reception\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"id\": 4,\n                  \"name\": \"Gym\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"id\": 22,\n                  \"name\": \"Luggage storage\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"id\": 9,\n                  \"name\": \"Wi-Fi\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"id\": 11,\n                  \"name\": \"Bar\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"id\": 1,\n                  \"name\": \"Breakfast\"\n                }\n              ],\n              \"openYear\": \"2022-04-01\",\n              \"fitmentYear\": \"2022-04-01\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"hotelId\": 54418318,\n              \"hotelUrl\": \"hampton-by-hilton-manchester-northern-quarter\",\n              \"hotelJumpUrl\": \"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/manchester-hotel-detail-54418318/hampton-by-hilton-manchester-northern-quarter/\",\n              \"hotelName\": \"Hampton by Hilton Manchester Northern Quarter\",\n              \"districtId\": 0,\n              \"hotelNameUrl\": \"/hotels/manchester-hotel-detail-54418318/hampton-by-hilton-manchester-northern-quarter/?checkin=2024-08-19&city=722&module=list&link=button&from_page=list&adult=1&checkout=2024-08-20\",\n              \"lat\": 53.4877584,\n              \"lon\": -2.2336475,\n              \"brief\": \"Located in the heart of Manchester's stylish Northern Quarter, the friendly Manchester awaits you at Hampton by Hilton Manchester Northern Quarter, City Centre. \\n\\nHampton by Hilton Manchester is an ideal destination for your next city break or base for exploring after a busy day in the office.

It seems poor practice to sell rooms when they knowingly have issues.   - Marks on pillowcases.  - Hole in the duvet cover, leaving a corner of the duvet to poke out.  - Dirty water glasses.  - Smears across bedroom mirror.   - Carpet is marked in many places (you wouldn\\u2019t want to walk barefoot).  - The toilet seat is only anchored to one side (so it moves constantly).  - Enclosed shower leaks into the bathroom.  - Shaver plug charged toothbrush intermittently.  - Not sure if the extractor worked; as the bathroom mirrors took a long time to clear after showering.  - The second keycard didn\\u2019t work.  - Aircon felt non-existent but was still noisy.  - No net or privacy filters on windows, so you either had to draw the blackout curtains completely or be seen by the adjacent hotel\\u2019s occupants.   Room flaws:   - The rainfall shower was terrific, but the small cubical made it impossible to move away from the water to apply soap/shampoo.  - The bedside light switches were too far away to reach from the bed.  - Windows looked double sealed, but you could still hear a local bar and their customers at 4 am from the third floor.  -   Breakfast:  - A little chaotic! Staff tried their best, but they seemed to struggle with replacing food.  - Cooked breakfast buffet was boiled to an inch of its life, no flavour in anything.  The pros:   - very good size bathroom, with separate shower and bath.

The hotel may say they are not at fault. But they are totally to blame. My evening was ruined because of lack of information on their website. I had plans at Manchester academy at 7.30. firstly I couldn't park because the car park was full. It was difficult enough getting to the place because of roadworks. I was then directed to another car park. But again because of road closures I or the staff had no idea how to get to it. Then when I had got checked in and parked I couldn't get a bus from the hotel because the road was closed and buses where not coming past.

The ladies WC by reception/bar smelt horrendous like public toilets despite appearing clean & water would not flow from the taps The room was not ready to check into until 1615hrs despite check in stating 1500hrs. No signature cocktail as part of our package on arrival, had to ask for them Was told that a check out time 48 hours after arrival didn\\u2019t exist but as a goodwill gesture would extend check out to 1300hrs instead of 1200hrs Coffee/milk not replenished after a clean of the room & dirty glasses not taken away Charged for mini bar items that we didn\\u2019t have. Was not presented a bill upon checking out so didn\\u2019t see until I looked at my bank statement. Also had to ask for my \\u00a350 room deposit to be refunded or that would have been taken too. A refund was provided upon asking.

The good. Excellent location and cool place to stay, they have dj\\u2019s  playing their sets through out the day. The music is good and not too loud so will suit all age groups, gives an insight into pub culture in the capital. The bed was really comfy, lucky enough to have stayed in some high end hotels and this bed is up there with the best. The not so good. The room wasn\\u2019t cleaned well, massive hand print on the mirror over the toilet and greasy head marks (I assume) on the windows. Whilst the bar price\\u2019s are reasonable for a London hotel the bar is terrible. When the supervisor is about it\\u2019s fine but that\\u2019s not often. It\\u2019s basically young lads running the bar ignoring your custom plying younger female customers with cocktails.  To be fair we probably wouldn\\u2019t have noticed but we sat at the bar upon returning from our function. It was some of the worst service we have experienced and no where near the service you would expect at this price point. The service is truly appalling given the cost. There are much better hotels that show respect for their customers, this place had a very impersonal and disrespectful air about it.  After 10pm the female toilet had a strong smell of urine and appeared very unclean. Great location for Westfield though. There are much better places to stay than this, and I highly recommend you find them.\",\n              \"rating\": 3,\n              \"avatarImgUrl\": \"\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"stimulation\": {\n            \"lastBookTime\": {\n              \"value\": 0,\n              \"unit\": \"Hour\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"commentTags\": [\n            \"Great stay!\",\n            \"Great location\"\n          ],\n          \"encourage\": {\n            \"breakfast\": true,\n            \"cancellation\": false\n          },\n          \"displayPrice\": {\n            \"price\": 119,\n            \"taxPrice\": 143,\n            \"oriPrice\": 139,\n            \"checkIn\": \"2024-08-18\"\n          },\n          \"trafficList\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": 1,\n              \"type\": 2,\n              \"description\": \"9.4km from London City Airport\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 2,\n              \"type\": 3,\n              \"description\": \"740m from Stratford Railway Station\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 3,\n              \"type\": 7,\n              \"description\": \"720m from Stratford\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 4,\n              \"type\": 7,\n              \"description\": \"1.5km from Leyton\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"hotelFacilityList\": [\n            {\n              \"id\": 2,\n              \"name\": \"Restaurant\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 20,\n              \"name\": \"24 hour reception\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 4,\n              \"name\": \"Gym\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 22,\n              \"name\": \"Luggage storage\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 9,\n              \"name\": \"Wi-Fi\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 25,\n              \"name\": \"Smoking area\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 11,\n              \"name\": \"Bar\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 1,\n              \"name\": \"Breakfast\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"id\": 24,\n              \"name\": \"Pets allowed\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"openYear\": \"2019-01-01\",\n          \"fitmentYear\": \"1753-01-01\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"hotelId\": 698608,\n          \"hotelUrl\": \"royale-chulan-kuala-lumpur\",\n          \"hotelJumpUrl\": \"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/kuala-lumpur-hotel-detail-698608/royale-chulan-kuala-lumpur/\",\n          \"hotelName\": \"Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur\",\n          \"districtName\": \"Titiwangsa\",\n          \"districtId\": 254241,\n          \"districtJumpUrl\": \"/hotels/list?city=315&optionType=Zone&optionId=254241\",\n          \"hotelNameUrl\": \"/hotels/kuala-lumpur-hotel-detail-698608/royale-chulan-kuala-lumpur/?checkin=2024-08-19&city=315&module=list&link=button&from_page=list&adult=1&checkout=2024-08-20\",\n          \"lat\": 3.1492588,\n          \"lon\": 101.7170562,\n          \"brief\": \"Located in Kuala Lumpur (Kuala Lumpur City Centre), Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur is within a 15-minute walk of Pavilion Kuala Lumpur and KLCC Park.

However, first of all, check-in isn't until 4pm which is later than any hostel I've ever stayed at, and there's not even really any place inside to wait until then so you can't go inside until after that time (unless you want to pay extra to go earlier).  Second, you have to pay 10 extra pounds, in cash, for a key and at least one of the staff members was pretty rude. I accidentally forgot my key to my room one day and then randomly a staff member shows up and yelled at me for waiting in the hallway for someone to come because no one at reception answered the door when I knocked to ask about a spare key.  Third of all, the area is kind of sketchy. Even though you can find homeless people scattered around the London metro area I was probably approached the most by homeless people either just outside of this hostel or on one of the nearby streets.  You also can't get refunded once you book and, for some reason, hostelworld said my recent trip there was cancelled (which is why I couldn't put this review on hostelworld).  Therefore, unless you're with a group of people and don't mind the most awful place to stay and/or you'd like to be within a 30-minute walk to Greenwich, I would highly highly highly NOT recommend this place (especially as a solo traveller)!\",\n              \"rating\": 1,\n              \"avatarImgUrl\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"nickName\": \"Guest User\",\n              \"regionCode\": \"\",\n              \"content\": \"At first, there is no lobby in this hotel.

It's an easy 5min walk from King's Cross station, so the location is perfect. Its low-cost made me choose it over other London hostels. Check-in was a breeze and the staff are some of the friendliest I've met (and I'm a travel writer!). However there's room for improvement with the dorms. The dorms were almost clinical-like and while there's underbed storage, the corner ones were hard to use, especially when you're trying to be quiet in the morning. The worst thing about the hostel were the beds themselves. The bedding was so thin and uncomfortable I wondered if I'd ever get to sleep. Also the shelf above the bed means you can't sit upright (at least on the bottom bunks). Instead of a sink in the dorm there should be more washbasins in the shower room as it makes getting ready for the day harder than needs to be (and disruptive to other dormmates). Only two of the three showers on my floor were working and shower gel would be a simple and low-cost inclusion. Sadly despite its ease and low cost I probably wouldn't stay here again.\",\n              \"rating\": 3,\n              \"avatarImgUrl\": \"\"\n            },\n            {\n              \"nickName\": \"Guest User\",\n              \"regionCode\": \"\",\n              \"content\": \"Staff at reception were nice and check in was easy.

There wasn\\u2019t a female toilet / shower on the 3rd floor where I was which was really annoying. I used the ones on the 2nd floor which seemed dirty.
